    "<h1 align=\"center\">Evaluating and Improving a LlamaIndex Search and Retrieval Application using Milvus as a Vector Store</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're an engineer at Arize AI and you've built and deployed a documentation question-answering service using LlamaIndex. Users send questions about Arize's core product via a chat interface, and your service retrieves documents from your documentation in order to generate a response to the user. As the engineer in charge of evaluating and maintaining this system, you want to evaluate the quality of the responses from your service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phoenix helps you:\n",
    "- identify gaps in your documentation\n",
    "- detect queries for which the LLM gave bad responses\n",
    "- detect failures to retrieve relevant context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load pre-built knowledge data into a Milvus vector store on Zilliz Cloud\n",
    "- Download a pre-indexed knowledge base of the Arize documentation and run a LlamaIndex application\n",
    "- Visualize user queries and knowledge base documents to identify areas of user interest not answered by your documentation\n",
    "- Find clusters of responses with negative user feedback\n",
    "- Identify failed retrievals using cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and LLM-assisted ranking metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chatbot Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Your chatbot was built using LlamaIndex's low-level API. The architecture of your chatbot is shown below and can be explained in five steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "![llama-index chatbot architecture](http://storage.googleapis.com/arize-assets/phoenix/assets/docs/notebooks/llama-index-knowledge-base-tutorial/llama_index_chatbot_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user sends a query about Arize to your service.\n",
    "1. `langchain.embeddings.OpenAIEmbeddings` makes a request to the OpenAI embeddings API to embed the user query using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model.\n",
    "1. `llama_index.retrievers.RetrieverQueryEngine` does a similarity search against the entries of your index knowledge base for the two most similar pieces of context by cosine similarity.\n",
    "1. `llama_index.indices.query.ResponseSynthesizer` generates a response by formatting the query and retrieved context into a single prompt and sending a request to OpenAI chat completions API with the `gpt-3.5-turbo`.\n",
    "2. The response is returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phoenix makes your search and retrieval system *observable* by capturing the inputs and outputs of these steps for analysis, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- your query embeddings\n",
    "- the retrieved context and similarity scores for each query\n",
    "- the generated response that is return to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "With that overview in mind, let's dive into the notebook."
